# Casting

Sometimes, you may need to explicitly convert a value to a specific data type. This process is called casting.
Since Python is an object-oriented language, it uses classes to represent all data types, including basic built-ins.

## Integer

```python
x = int(1)  # x will be 1
y = int(2.5)  # y will be 2
z = int("5")  # z will be 5
```

## Float

```python
a = float(1)  # a will be 1.0
b = float(5.5)  # b will be 5.5
c = float("5")  # c will be 5.0
d = float("5.5")  # d will be 5.5
```

## Strings

```python
x = str("x1")  # x will be 'x1'
y = str(5)  # y will be '5'
z = str(5.0)  # z will be '5.0'
```
