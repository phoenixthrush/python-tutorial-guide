# Variables

A variable is a container for storing data values.

To create a variable, you must first assign a value to it.

```python
x = 3
y = "Cats"

print(x)
print(y)
```

Variables do not need to be declared as a specific type, and they can change type after being set. We will discuss data types in a later chapter. For now, it is sufficient to know that Python allows this.

```python
x = 50  # x is of type int
x = "Cats"  # x is now of type str

print(x)
```
